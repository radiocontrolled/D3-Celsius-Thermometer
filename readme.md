# About 
The D3.JS Celsius thermometer uses data from the <a href="http://openweathermap.org/">Open Weather Map API</a> and allows users to search and display the temperature for a city. 

## Roadmap 
- create a function so that when a user selects a city with more than one result, the user can click to clarify the region they intended to search for
- use HTML instead of <text> elements for the search form
- write media queries for the thermometer's labels
