# About 
The D3.JS Celsius thermometer uses data from the <a href="http://openweathermap.org/">Open Weather Map API</a> and allows users to search and display the temperature for a city. 

## Roadmap 
- create spinner, so that when the mercury is taking a long time to load the user doesn't leave
- write tests 
- add globe - http://bl.ocks.org/KoGor/5994804 ?
