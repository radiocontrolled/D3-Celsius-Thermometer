D3.JS Celsius thermometer which uses data from the <a href="http://openweathermap.org/">Open Weather Map API</a>. 


roadmap
- create a function so that when a user selects a city with more than one result, the user can click to clarify the region they intended to search for, and that city populates the search box 
- on resize(), if a temperature has already been searched for, the mercury should not be removed
- redraw the thermometer on resize(), in a way that makes it readible at smaller viewport sizes 
- use HTML instead of <text> elements for the search form
- write media queries for thermometer scale text 
- write tests
